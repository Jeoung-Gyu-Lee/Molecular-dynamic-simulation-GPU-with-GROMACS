# Molecular-dynamic-simulation-GPU-with-GROMACS
Molecular Dynamic simulation with GPU build was performed  using GROMACS 2025.2. This pipeline includes the sequential steps such as GPU build, preparing receptor and ligand topology with pre-docking PDB file (AutodockVina),  building complex, adding ions for neutral,  energy minimization, and equilibration with NVT, NPT.
